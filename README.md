Identification of the Feature most Responsible for Accurate Heart Disease Prediction

Machine Learning algorithms have found their applications in various
domains over the past decade. A class of machine learning algorithms
that have garnered profound attention and are widely being used for
data analysis are the classification algorithms. Classification
algorithms are used to classify large scale data into two or more
classes. There are a number of algorithms such as Support Vector
Machine, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest which are used to
perform classification. Heart disease is as a major public health
problem that has caused premature deaths all over the world. In the
present decade, there is a need for a system to tackle this problem by
using the latest technical developments. Many machine learning
techniques have been employed independently to be able to predict
the presence of heart diseases in individuals based on structured and
unstructured healthcare data.

Studies suggest that this accuracy rate is interlinked with the selection
of the features from the available dataset. For appropriate selection of
features, Principal Component Analysis(PCA) has been used. The
drawback of this approach is that it leads to lower accuracies. Thus,
better feature selection increases the quality of the prediction model.
In this study, we take reference from the study of Cleveland heart
disease dataset from the UCI-Repository will be used to get the best
combination of six features after testing each possible combination
from all the thirteen features available against all the four classifiers
mentioned above. Each combination will be assigned an individual
score, which will correspond to its weighted mean of the accuracy
obtained on all the four classifiers. Furthermore, this research will find
out the most prominent feature out of all the thirteen features by
counting the number of occurrences of each element in the top
hundred combinations giving the maximum score. Thus, this model
provides us with an insight into the characteristic feature that has the
maximum correlation with the accuracy of the prediction models.
